📌 Project Description
The goal of this project is to build a Next Sentence Prediction system that generates intelligent and contextually appropriate sentences using pre-trained transformer models like GPT-2. The application is available both as a notebook for experimentation and as a simple web app built using Streamlit.

🧠 Features
Predicts one or more plausible next sentences given an input sentence/paragraph.

Uses state-of-the-art NLP models such as GPT-2, GPT2-Medium, and DistilGPT-2.

User can configure model parameters such as temperature, prediction count, and max length.

Streamlit-based web interface for real-time interaction.

Includes copy and full-text preview functionality.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

HuggingFace Transformers

Jupyter Notebook

Streamlit

PyTorch

NLTK, NumPy, tqdm

🚀 How to Use
▶️ Google Colab Version:
Open the file Next_Sentence_Prediction.ipynb in Google Colab.

Run all cells to load the model.

Enter your sentence in the prompt and generate predictions.
